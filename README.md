# Github Repo Directory Project

## Managing the Project with SDLC

While creating that project we wil use SDLC steps to create a managable and scalable project. Let's start

## 1 - Requirements Gathering & Analysis

- [x] Identifying the project's scope.
- [x] Gathering requirements for the UI toolkit based on project needs (performance, customization, ease of use).
- [x] Researching potential users' needs and preferences regarding UI/UX.
- [x] Creating github issues for each requirements

## 2 - Design

- [x] Comparing the possible UI toolkits and libraries based on the requirements based on Customizability, Performance, Community support and documentation
- [x] Finalizing the choice of UI toolkit.
- [x] Designing the application architecture.
- [x] Creating wireframes and mockups.


### UI Toolkit Comparison: Mantinw UI, Material UI, and Chakra UI

The comparison aims to assist in making an informed decision on the most suitable UI framework for our development needs.

| Feature/Criteria          | Mantine UI                                  | Material UI                                         | Chakra UI                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Customization**         | High customization with less effort.        | Extensive customization but can be more complex.    | Easy and flexible customization.                    |
| **Performance**           | Optimized for speed and efficiency.         | Good, but can be heavy for complex applications.    | Balanced performance, good for dynamic UIs.         |
| **Ease of Use**           | Simple API and easy to learn.               | Steep learning curve due to comprehensive features. | Intuitive API, easy to use and learn.               |
| **Community Support**     | Growing community, responsive support.      | Large community, extensive resources and support.   | Strong community, good documentation and support.   |
| **Documentation**         | Well-documented with examples.              | Extensive and detailed documentation.               | Comprehensive documentation with examples.          |
| **Accessibility**         | Focus on accessibility with ARIA support.   | Strong emphasis on accessibility.                   | Good accessibility features and best practices.     |
| **Mobile Responsiveness** | Fully responsive components.                | Responsive design is a core feature.                | Responsive components with mobile-first approach.   |
| **Popularity**            | Increasing popularity, newer in the market. | Most popular, widely adopted.                       | Rapidly gaining popularity.                         |
| **Unique Features**       | Lightweight, modern UI, less boilerplate.   | Material Design principles, rich components.        | Easy theming, focus on composition and flexibility. |


### UI Toolkit Decision

- **Mantine UI** offers a balance between customization, ease of use, and performance, making it a strong candidate for projects prioritizing developer experience and speed.
- **Material UI** is suited for applications that benefit from Material Design and require a comprehensive suite of components.
- **Chakra UI** is ideal for projects that emphasize accessibility, simplicity, and ease of theming.

As I am the only developer in the current project, I will choose the one which can be learned easily. So that after inspecting its Table component and other ready-to-go custom hooks, **Mantine UI** will be my choice.
